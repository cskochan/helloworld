# helloworld
The Ubiquitous Hello World Program

## What is this
This is simply to go through the motions and make sure I know how I want to do everything.

## Inspiration
The best way to break the ice is with a good old fashioned 'Hello World!'

## Prerequisites
Python3

## Getting and Running helloworld
``` bash
git clone https://www.github.com/cskochan/helloworld
cd helloworld
python3 helloworld.py
```

## How it was built
VS Code on a Macbook Pro running Ubuntu

## What I learned
I learned the basics on how to use git and GitHub, and refreshed my knowledge on VS Code.

## What's next
The test is complete. I may refine the README.md, but the next goal is design of the portfolio page itself, a simple ~200 line program to kick things off, and cracking into Code Complete 2nd Ed.
